# Omarchy Retro Fallout Theme

**Vault-Tec approved: A post-apocalyptic glow-up for your Omarchy desktop.** Dive into the irradiated charm of *Fallout* with rusty reds, glowing greens, and vault-door vibes. This theme turns your Linux rig into a survivor’s bunker, perfect for coding through the nuclear winter or just nuking your productivity (in a good way).

## Notes

- **Fastfetch Config**: Drop-in `config.jsonc` for wasteland-ready system info. Copy it to `~/.config/fastfetch/` and watch your stats load like a holotape.
- **ASCII Art**: The `about.txt` file packs custom Fallout-flavored ASCII—paste it into your welcome screen or MOTD for instant immersion.

## The Origin Story: From X Banter to Bunker Build

This theme? Born from a chaotic X thread that spiraled faster than a Deathclaw on Jet. It all kicked off when I geeked out over a retro terminal tip from [@Ron_Dilley](https://x.com/Ron_Dilley), yelling "Fallout vibes!" [@sm_salmaan](https://x.com/sm_salmaan) nailed it. Ron reposted, tempting [@iamdothash](https://x.com/iamdothash) to theme-ify it. Next thing: "I NEED a retro Fallout theme for my new @FrameworkPuter desktop!" Cue high-res maps, Omarchy logos, and me whispering, "something may be in the works..."

Check the full fallout (pun intended): [The Spark on X](https://x.com/zdanailov7/status/1971322051840573503)

Huge thanks to Ron for the first wallpaper, Bjarne for the temptation, and the Omarchy community for the opportunity. This is build-in-public at its irradiated best.
